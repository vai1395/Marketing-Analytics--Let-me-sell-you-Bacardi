# Bacardi Marketing Project

## Market Overview

In our quest for market dominance, we began with a comprehensive analysis of top brands, scrutinizing their strengths and weaknesses. Bacardi Gold emerged as a shining star, commanding a higher selling price than Luxco, thereby securing a 49% value share against Paramount Gold's 30%. However, in volume share, Bacardi trailed slightly at 37%, compared to Paramount's 53%.

## Competitor Identification

Utilizing T-SNE data reduction and K-means clustering, we pinpointed Luxco as our primary competitor. This strategic insight paved the way for targeted efforts to strengthen our market presence.

## Mix Optimization

A deeper dive into the data unveiled opportunities for growth. Bacardi Gold, with its higher selling price, presented a chance to increase volume sales. Implementing a discount pricing strategy emerged as a potential game-changer, enabling us to acquire a larger market share.

**Comments & Insights:**
Bacardi Gold's market position can be significantly fortified with increased volume sales, and a discount pricing strategy might be the key to expanding market share.

## Regression Model

Building on our analysis, a regression model predicted a positive correlation between Gold Rum sales volume and a decrease in cost. Specifically, Gold Rum sales could increase by approximately 29 liters for every $1 decrease in cost.

## Discount Optimization with Solver

To further enhance our strategy, we employed Solver to optimize discounts, aiming to maximize the gain in margin.

**Results:**
After applying the optimal discount, the margin per bottle may decrease initially, but the overall impact results in a remarkable 66% increase in margin as volume rises.

**Recommendation:**

The future holds the promise of increased market dominance and elevated brand prominence. Cheers to the journey ahead! ðŸ¥‚âœ¨
